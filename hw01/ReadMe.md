6. I wrote an etch-a-sketch program... details below

# Etch-A-Sketch!

### Implementation
This was implemented by using ncurses to read user input and put a `#` on the screen.

### Usage
Get required libraries with `install.sh`. Make the program with `make`. Run the program by entering `./main <rows> <columns>`.

### Playing
Use arrow keys or WASD to move, and the home key or spacebar to 'shake' (clear) the screen.

Well done.  ncurses is a nice touch

Score:  10/10
