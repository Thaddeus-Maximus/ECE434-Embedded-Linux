Homework 4! Yay!

My C program `gpioThru.c` mirrors gpio0_2 and gpio0_3 to gpio1_16 and gpio1_18.

My C program `speedToggle.c` toggles gpio1_18 as fast as possible. The minimum bound seems to be a 160 nanosecond period, which is very low!

See image.png for Boris, rotated.

Professor Yoder's Comments

Looks good, but I don't see your Memory Map answers.
How does your toggle time compare with pervious times?
No demo, yet.  I'll add two points once demoed.

Score:  5/10
