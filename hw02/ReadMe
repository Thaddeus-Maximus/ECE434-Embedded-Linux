1. Min: 0V Max: 2.6V
2. Period: 101 ms
3. 1 ms off
4. We are enforcing the period by waiting for 100 ms between code execution. Code execution takes ~ 1ms in this case.
5. htop reports ~ 5% of the processor is being used.
6. 184 microseconds is the smallest preiod I can get.
7. It isn't very stable.
8. It gets even less stable!
9. Yes, this enables the period to be shorter.
10. I can't get this to work.
11. See 10

# Usage:
